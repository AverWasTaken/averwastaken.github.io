                    When I first met Mo, and joined The Playground, I was stunned by the level of organization, leadership, and just overall fun that the server offered.
                    Not only was there a bunch of fun community events, but there was an abundance of places to share my clips, playlists, and even the meals I might of 
                    been eating that day. Personally, these are just a few reasons why I love The Playground. <br> <span class="cred">- ayvyr | lead developer</span>
